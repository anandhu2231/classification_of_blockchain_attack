<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

###

<p align="left">- This project aims to categorize attacks within blockchain networks, focusing on individual blockchain components and providing a comprehensive framework for identifying and analyzing these attacks.<br><br>- Wallet, Consensus Mechanism, Mining pool, Peer-to-Peer network, and Smart Contracts are the blockchain components.<br><br>- The primary purpose is to give a precise taxonomy that categorizes various attack paths, allowing for a better understanding of risks and vulnerabilities in the context of blockchain components.</p>

<h2 align="left">Problem Statement</h2>

###

<p align="left">- Blockchain technology is intended to be safe and resistant to unauthorized changes, however it is not immune to certain sorts of attacks.<br><br>- Attacks on blockchain, such as 51% attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, can erode trust in cryptocurrencies and financial products, potentially reducing their adoption. <br><br>- This review paper will investigate blockchain component attacks, examining weaknesses and security challenges in important areas like as consensus procedures, smart contracts, cryptography, and network protocols.<br><br>- Among the main components that will be focused on are consensus mechanisms, mining, mining pools, peer-to-peer networks, ledgers, wallets, networks and smart contracts.</p>

<h2 align="left">What is Blockchain</h2>

###

<p align="left">Blockchain is a decentralized system that records information in a secure manner, resembling a digital ledger. It is distributed across a network of computer systems, with each block containing multiple transactions. Each block is secured using cryptographic principles, giving it its name. Blockchain is most commonly used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it can also be used for secure medical records sharing, supply chain monitoring, and real-time IoT operating systems. Its key advantages include transparency, security, and resistance to tampering, making it a valuable tool for securely recording transactions and managing data.</p>

<h2 align="left">How Blockchain Works</h2>

###

<p align="left">The blockchain is a tool for docume­nting data which turns it tough to alter or trick. It resemble­s an electronic record of e­xchanges that's copied and spread on a whole­ system of computers. Every blockchain's block holds many transactions, and whe­n a fresh transaction happens on the blockchain, that transaction's re­cord is added to each participant's record. This de­centralized database that is manage­d by several participants is called Distribute­d Ledger Technology (DLT).<br><br>Blockchain’s security and integrity depend on creating every block using its own distinctive hash, along with the has of all the preceding blocks in the chain. Then each of these is time-stamped and given a cryptographic signature which connects the new block to the previous one so strongly that no transaction from the past can be changed without altering all subsequent blocks and getting the entire network to agree with the change. The system is incorruptible and transparent for recording the transactions as this chain of blocks is continually updated and verified by the network. The basis of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, it is capable of providing solutions like supply chain management, verifying digital identity and secure voting system among many others.</p>
